                <p className="text-yellow-700 mb-4">
                  Remember that you don't have to rank all five candidates. If you want to ensure a progressive 
                  mayor, it's better to rank only the candidates you truly support rather than including 
                  Andrew Cuomo in your rankings.
                </p>
                <p className="text-yellow-700">
                  Even ranking Cuomo as your 5th choice could help him win if your higher-ranked candidates 
                  are eliminated. The "Anyone But Cuomo" strategy means exactly thatâ€”don't rank him at all.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Andrew Cuomo's entry into the mayoral race presents a challenge for progressive voters. 
                His name recognition gives him an advantage, but his record shows he often sides with 
                corporate interests over working New Yorkers.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The "Anyone But Cuomo" (ABC) strategy is simple: rank the five DSA-endorsed candidates 
                featured in this guide in whatever order you prefer, but do not include Cuomo in your rankings.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                This approach maximizes the chance that one of these progressive candidates will win, 
                rather than splitting the progressive vote and allowing Cuomo to benefit.
